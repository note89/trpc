It creates a recursive proxy that intercepts API calls and routes them to the appropriate client method.\n\nHere's how it works:\n1. It uses `createRecursiveProxy` to generate a proxy object that mimics the structure of your API.\n2. When you make a call like `api.users.getUser(1)`, the proxy intercepts this call.\n3. It constructs the full path ('users.getUser') and determines the procedure type (query, mutation, etc.).\n4. Finally, it calls the appropriate client method with the constructed path and arguments.\n\nThis proxy structure, combined with TypeScript's type inference, ensures that only valid API calls with correct types are allowed at compile-time. For example, `api.users.getUser('1')` would raise a type error if `getUser` expects a number.\n\nThis clever use of proxies and TypeScript's type system is what enables tRPC to provide its signature end-to-end type safety.",
